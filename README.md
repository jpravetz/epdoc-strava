# Strava KML File Generator

## Overview

A command line application `bin/strava` to generate KML files suitable for
import into Google Earth. Strava authorization will open a browser page. Uses
[Strava V3 APIs](https://developers.strava.com). Can output two types of
information:

- Your activities, color coded by activity type, and optionally including a
  description and [starred
  segment](<(http://blog.strava.com/keep-track-of-your-favorites-with-starred-segments-6260/)>)
  times
- Your efforts for segments that you have [starred in
  Strava](http://blog.strava.com/keep-track-of-your-favorites-with-starred-segments-6260/),
  optionally including a description that lists all your times (__NOT WORKING__ )

## Installation

This application is written for nodejs in [typescript](http://typescript.org) for node,
requiring that you install `nodejs`, `npm`, this application and it's dependent libraries
on your computer.

- [Install node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Install and use git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Clone or download a zip of [this project](https://github.com/jpravetz/strava)
  and install it's nodejs library dependencies

```bash
cd $HOME/dev      # for example
git clone https://github.com/jpravetz/strava.git
cd strava
npm install
```

- Create the folder `$HOME/.strava` (used to store `credentials.json` and `segments.json`)
- Optionally create a `$HOME/.strava/user.settings.json` config file as show under User Settings
- If not already compiled, compile the application (compiler output is written to the `/dist` folder)

```bash
npm run build
```

- Test that the application is working using `bin/strava --help`

```bash
strava -h

  Usage: strava [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                 output usage information
    -V, --version              output the version number
    -d, --dates <dates>        Comma separated list of activity date or date ranges in format '20141231-20150105,20150107'. If the last entry in the list is a single date then everything from that date until today will be included.
    -i, --id <athleteId>       Athlete ID. Defaults to your login
    -u, --athlete              Show athlete details including list of bikes
    -g, --friends [opt]        Show athlete friends list (Use --more a complete summary, otherwise id and name are displayed)
    -k, --kml <file>           Create KML file for specified date range
    -x, --xml <file>           Create Acroforms XML file for specified date range, this is specific to a particular unpublished PDF form document
    -r, --refresh              Refresh list of starred segments rather than using local stored copy. Will automatically refresh from server if there is no locally stored copy.
    -a, --activities [filter]  Output activities to kml file, optionally filtering by activity type (as defined by Strava, 'Ride', 'Hike', 'Walk', etc), plus 'commute' and 'nocommute')
    -s, --segments [opts]      Output starred segments to KML, adding efforts within date range to description if --more. Segments are grouped into folders by location unless opts is set to 'flat'.
    -m, --more                 When generating KML file, include additional detail info in KML description field
    -y, --imperial             Use imperial units
    -p, --path <cwd>           Current folder
    -v, --verbose              Verbose messages
```

Notes:

1. `$HOME` is resolved by trying, in order, the `ENV` variables: `HOME`, `HOMEPATH`
   and `USERPROFILE`.
1. `bin/strava` is a `bash` script that adds the `--path` option and executes the nodejs application.
1. `athleteId` will be automatically determined from your authentication (the `--id` option is ignored for now).
1. Output of starred segments (`--segments`) is currently broken

## Strava Command Line Application

The command line application can be used to query Strava and:

- Return details for an athlete (`--athlete`)
- Return your list of bikes (currently not working)
- Refresh your list of starred segments (`--refresh`)
- Generate a KML file that contains activity routes for the range of dates
  and/or starred segments and corresponding segment efforts within the date
  range (`-a -m --kml myfile.kml -d 20191015`)

Notes:

- You will be required to authenticate by logging into your Strava account.
  - Tokens retrieved from this login are stored in`~/.strava/credentials.json`.
- There is a Strava limit of 200 activities per call, so for date ranges that
  include more than 200 activities, only the first 200 activities are returned.

### Example Command Line Use

Create a KML file that includes all activities for the first half of 2013. Add detailed descriptions to each activity.

```bash
bin/strava.js --date 20130101-20130630 --kml ~/tmp/activities.kml --activities --more
```

Create a KML file that shows all of your starred segments and lists your times for those efforts (currently not working)

```bash
bin/strava.js --date 20100101-20141231 --kml ~/tmp/activities.kml --segments --more
```

### User Settings

The user settings file is stored at `$HOME/.strava/user.settings.json`.

```json
{
  "lineStyles": {
    "Commute": { "color": "C03030C0", "width": 4 },
    "Run": { "color": "C000FF00", "width": 4 }
  }
}
```

`lineStyles` defines the colors used for different activities (_e.g._ `Ride`, `Hike`, etc.), commutes and segments.

Defaults line styles are set in `defaultLineStyles` in [src/kml.ts](https://github.com/jpravetz/strava/blob/master/src/kml.ts) and [src/config/project.settings.json](https://github.com/jpravetz/strava/blob/master/src/config/project.settings.json)/

```json
{
  "lineStyles": {
    "Default": { "color": "C00000FF", "width": 4 },
    "Ride": { "color": "C00000A0", "width": 4 },
    "Hike": { "color": "F0FF0000", "width": 4 },
    "Walk": { "color": "F0f08000", "width": 4 },
    "Sand Up Paddling": { "color": "F0f08000", "width": 4 },
    "Nordic Ski": { "color": "F0f08000", "width": 4 },
    "Commute": { "color": "C085037D", "width": 4 },
    "Segment": { "color": "C0FFFFFF", "width": 6 }
  }
}
```

`user.settings.json` is used to override default `lineStyles`. The keys in the `lineStyles`
object are the full activity name , and the values include KML line color
(`aabbggrr`, alpha, blue, green, red hex values) and line width.


### KML Description

Using `--more` will result in a description field being added to the KML activity or segment.
For activities this will include the following fields (see notes afterwards):

```
  Distance: 45.28 km
  Total Elevation Gain: 1507 m
  Moving Time: 03:47:41
  Average Temp: 22Â°C
  Grizzly Flat Fire Road: 00:23:08
  Tires: Knobbies
  Wt: 84.5kg
  Description: 1 garter snake, 1 banana slug, 1 deer, lots of California Salamanders
```

Notes:

1. The Strava `description` field is parsed. Any key/value pairs, represented by
   a line containing a string of the form `Tires=Knobbies`, will result in a
   separate line being added to the description output.
2. For segments, using `--more` will add some basic information about the
   segment _and_ add an ordered list of efforts you've made for that segment
   during the specified date range.

### Description Field Processing

Entries in the form `key=value` (_e.g._ `wt=84.1kg`) that on their own line in
the Strava description field will be parsed out for use downstream. For KML files,
these will be output as part of the activity description.

The
[strava-api.ts](https://github.com/jpravetz/strava/blob/master/src/strava-api.ts)
file is munged from an original implementation at
[mojodna](https://github.com/mojodna/node-strav3/blob/master/index.js).

## ToDo

- Handle paginated data, in other words, requests that exceed 200 activities.
  - Done for starred segments
- I started working on a PDF report generator, however I have barely begun this
  effort and will probably not ever complete it. It is at `bin/pdfgen.js`.
- Get `--segment` working again
- Fix authentication experience so tokens are held for longer
